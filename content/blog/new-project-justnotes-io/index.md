Recently, I started developing an app called [justnotes.io](https://justnotes.io) which Iâ€™m using to learn new stuff not only in the dev field but in design as well. My goal here is to learn and share knowledge with the community using a real project, so expect some upcoming blog posts about this app. 

The project uses [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/), React, and Typescript. Here is the link to the repo: [https://github.com/BrunoQuaresma/justnotes.io](https://github.com/BrunoQuaresma/justnotes.io). Take a look and feel free to open issues, pull requests, and/or leave comments for your questions or suggestions. Like I said, this is a learning project for the community and not only for me.

Thanks for your time. I hope you enjoyed.
